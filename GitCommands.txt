git clone URL
	This creates a copy of a repository. You can find the repo URL on github.com
git status
	Show the status of the project. Are there uncommitted files, etc. 

Push progression steps:
1.git pull
	This pulls all recent changes to the project and overrides your files with the changed files. Any unchanged files in the repo will not be copied
2.git add –A
	This adds all your changes to prepare to be pushed. It does not push!
3.git commit –m “Foo”
	This prepares any commit information to prepare to be pushed. It does not push! It allows for a message (-m) to be given and show up in the github repo
4.git push
	This will push your changes to the master, so the next time someone runs git pull your file changes will be copied to their machine.
